ArrayArrayLinearìA linear array is an ordered collection of elements, where each element is identified by its index, allowing for efficient access and modification.Binary Search TreeTree
Non-LinearA non-linear binary search tree is a tree data structure where each node has a value greater than all nodes in its left subtree and less than all nodes in its right subtree, allowing for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.GraphGraphs
Non-LinearvA non-linear graph is a collection of nodes connected by edges, where the connections do not follow a linear sequence.
Hash TableHash
Non-Linear|A hash table is a non-linear data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, mapping keys to values.HeapTree
Non-LinearßA non-linear heap tree is a specialized tree-based data structure that allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements, ensuring that the tree remains balanced.Linked ListListLinearòA linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, each containing a reference (link) to the next object in the sequence.ListListLinearëA linear list is a data structure where elements are arranged in a linear order, allowing sequential access. It includes arrays and linked lists.QueueAbstractLinear¨An abstract queue is a linear data structure that holds elements in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order, allowing addition of elements at one end and removal from the other.Self-Balance TreeTree
Non-LinearçA self-balancing tree automatically adjusts its structure to maintain balance, ensuring efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.SetAbstract
Non-LinearvAn abstract set is a collection of distinct elements, where each element is unique and does not have a specific order.StackAbstractLinear´An abstract Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, allowing elements to be added (pushed) and removed (popped) from the top.Two Dimension ArrayArrayLinear‘A two-dimensional array is a data structure that stores elements in a matrix format, allowing for two levels of indexing. It's used for representing tabular data or for calculations involving multiple dimensions.
